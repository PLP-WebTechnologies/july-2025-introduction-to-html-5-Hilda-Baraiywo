        <h2>Introduction to Embedded Systems</h2>
        <p>Embedded systems are specialized computing systems that perform dedicated functions within larger mechanical or electrical systems. Unlike general-purpose computers, embedded systems are designed for specific tasks and often operate with real-time computing constraints.</p>
            
        <h3>What Makes Systems "Embedded"</h3>
            <p>Embedded systems are characterized by their integration into larger systems, resource constraints, real-time requirements, and dedicated functionality. They power everything from automotive control units to smart home devices and medical equipment.</p>

            <h3>Key Characteristics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Resource-constrained environments with limited memory and processing power</li>
                <li>Real-time operation requirements for time-critical applications</li>
                <li>Low power consumption for battery-operated devices</li>
                <li>Reliability and fault tolerance for mission-critical systems</li>
                <li>Cost-effectiveness for mass production</li>
            </ul>

    <section id="microcontrollers">
            <h2>Microcontroller Fundamentals</h2>
            <p>Microcontrollers are the heart of most embedded systems, integrating a processor, memory, and input/output peripherals on a single chip.</p>
            
            <h3>Popular Microcontroller Architectures</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>ARM Cortex-M series for high-performance applications</li>
                <li>AVR microcontrollers used in Arduino platforms</li>
                <li>PIC microcontrollers for cost-effective solutions</li>
                <li>ESP32/ESP8266 for Wi-Fi enabled IoT projects</li>
                <li>STM32 family for advanced embedded applications</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Programming Microcontrollers</h3>
            <p>Embedded programming typically involves C/C++ languages, assembly language for performance-critical sections, and increasingly, higher-level languages like Python for rapid prototyping on powerful microcontrollers.</p>

            <h3>Memory Management</h3>
            <p>Understanding different types of memory in microcontrollers is crucial: Flash memory for program storage, SRAM for variables and stack, and EEPROM for non-volatile data storage. Efficient memory usage is essential due to resource constraints.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="real-time-systems">
            <h2>Real-Time Systems Design</h2>
            <p>Real-time systems must respond to inputs within specified time constraints. Missing deadlines can lead to system failure or degraded performance.</p>
            
            <h3>Types of Real-Time Systems</h3>
            <p>Hard real-time systems have strict deadlines that must never be missed, such as automotive airbag controllers. Soft real-time systems can occasionally miss deadlines with degraded performance, like multimedia streaming applications.</p>
            
            <h3>Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)</h3>
            <p>RTOS provides deterministic behavior for time-critical applications through features like priority-based scheduling, interrupt handling, and task synchronization mechanisms.</p>

            <h3>Common RTOS Options</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>FreeRTOS - Open-source RTOS for microcontrollers</li>
                <li>Zephyr - Scalable RTOS for connected and resource-constrained devices</li>
                <li>ThreadX - Commercial RTOS with advanced features</li>
                <li>VxWorks - Industrial-grade RTOS for mission-critical applications</li>
                <li>µC/OS - Real-time kernel for embedded systems</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Task Scheduling and Synchronization</h3>
            <p>Effective task scheduling ensures that high-priority tasks meet their deadlines. Synchronization mechanisms like semaphores, mutexes, and message queues coordinate communication between tasks safely.</p>

        <section id="iot-development">
            <h2>Internet of Things (IoT) Development</h2>
            <p>IoT extends embedded systems by adding connectivity, enabling devices to communicate with cloud services and other devices over networks.</p>
            
            <h3>IoT Communication Protocols</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Wi-Fi for high-bandwidth local connectivity</li>
                <li>Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for short-range, low-power communication</li>
                <li>LoRaWAN for long-range, low-power wide-area networks</li>
                <li>MQTT for lightweight publish-subscribe messaging</li>

                <li>Zigbee for mesh networking in home automation</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Edge Computing</h3>
            <p>Processing data locally on embedded devices reduces latency, bandwidth usage, and improves privacy. Edge AI enables intelligent decision-making at the device level.</p>

            <h3>Security Considerations</h3>
            <p>IoT security involves secure boot processes, encrypted communication, regular firmware updates, and robust authentication mechanisms to protect against cyber threats.</p>
